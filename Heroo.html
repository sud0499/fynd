                Eagles are large, powerful Birds of Prey. They belong to several Genera which are not necessarily closely related to each other. They are Diurnal Birds which means that they are mostly active during daytime. Eagles are different from many other Birds of Prey mainly by their larger size, more powerful build, and heavier head and beak. Even the smallest Eagles, like the Booted Eagle has relatively longer and more evenly broad wings. Majority of the Eagle Species occur in Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just two Species (the Bald  and Golden Eagles) can be found in the United States and Canada, nine more in Central and South America, and three in Australia. An Eagle may resemble a Vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons. There are approximately 59 different Species of Eagles. Scientists have categorised Eagles into Four Different Groups -  i) The Sea and Fish Eagles, ii) the Snake Eagles, iii) the Harpy Eagles, and iv) the Booted Eagles. Female Eagles are larger than the Males, outweighing them by as much as 30 percent. The age of Eagles varies with species; both the Bald Eagle and the Golden Eagle may survive 30 or more years.
